# circulation-patron-web
A Circulation Manager web interface for library patrons.

## Running the application
There are three ways to run this application:
* with a [library registry](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/library_registry)
* with a single library on a [circulation manager](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/circulation)
* with a configuration file for multiple circulation manager URLs

By default, it expects a library registry to be running at http://localhost:7000.

Any circulation manager you'll be using with the app also needs a configuration setting to turn on CORS headers. In the admin interface, go to the Sitewide Settings section under System Configuration and add a setting for "URL of the web catalog for patrons". For development, you can set this to "*", but for production it should be the real URL where you will run the catalog. If you are using a library registry, this configuration will automatically be created when you register libraries with the registry, but you need to configure the URL in the registry by running `bin/configuration/configure_site_setting --setting="web_client_url=http://library.org/{uuid}"` (replace the URL with your web client URL). Otherwise, you'll need to create a sitewide setting for it in the circulation manager.

Once you have a library registry or circulation manager, run `npm install` in this repository to set up dependencies.

Then you can run either `npm run dev` or `npm run prod` to start the application. `npm run dev` will watch the code for changes and rebuild the front-end code, but won't reload the server code.

Set one of the following environment variables when running the application:
* To configure a library registry url, set the environment variable `REGISTRY_BASE`.
   * This is the default setting which will point to the Library Registry located at `localhost:7000`. The libraries can be viewed in the app (running locally) by going to `localhost:3000/{uuid}` where `uuid` is the `uuid` of the library.
* To use a circulation manager, set `SIMPLIFIED_CATALOG_BASE`.
   * Point this environment variable to the url of the Circulation Manager, for example `SIMPLIFIED_CATALOG_BASE=http://localhost:6500 npm run prod`. This will load the main library in the Circulation Manager in the app (running locally) by going to `localhost:3000`.
* To use a configuration file, set `CONFIG_FILE` to point to a local file or a remote URL. Each line in the file should be a library's desired URL path in the web catalog and the library's circ manager URL, separated by a pipe character. For example:
   * ```
      library1|http://circulationmanager.org/L1
      library2|http://circulationmanager.org/L2
      ```
   * An example command: `CONFIG_FILE=config_file.txt npm run prod`. From the example above, when running the command you can visit the app (running locally) at `localhost:3000/library1` and `localhost:3000/library2` for each library.

Set `SHORTEN_URLS=false` to stop the app from removing common parts of the circulation manager URLs from the web app's URLs.

Set `CACHE_EXPIRATION_SECONDS` to control how often the app will check for changes to registry entries and circ manager authentication documents.
